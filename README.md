### I.	Image Blurring using Box Blur Algorithm :
A box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is a spatial domain linear filter in which each pixel in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of its neighboring pixels in the input image. It is a form of low-pass ("blurring") filter.

### II.	Convert Image to greyscale using weighted method or luminosity method:
This Method averages the values, but it forms a weighted average to account for human perception. We are more sensitive to green than other colors, so green is weighted most heavily. Three different colors have three different wavelength and have their own contribution in the formation of image.

Grayscale Image = ( (0.3 * R) + (0.59 * G) + (0.11 * B) )

### Code Includes implementation of above algorithms for CPU or GPU.
